# Clogger
It's a keylogger, but written in C

this code log all the keystrokes into file called GoogleCloudPlatform.log (random...yeah) inside the user %temp% file.
the log is rc4 encrypted with hardcoded char encrypt_with[].

this code should also take pictures of the user screen in other thread, and save them into %temp%/Google_images${rand_num}.bmp, but that's buggy..



I suck at C. so this code is a mess, I wroted this to practice
